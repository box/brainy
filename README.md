# Brainy

Brainy is a replacement for the popular [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/)
templating language. It is a fork from the Smarty 3 trunk.

Brainy is still very new and it's likely that you will encounter some issues.
Please report any problems that you encounter.


## Why Brainy?

- Brainy generates clean and fast code by default.
- Brainy has security defaults that align better with [best practices](http://www.phptherightway.com/#security).
- Brainy does not include features that are infrequently used and increase code bloat.

Because Brainy is a fork of Smarty 3, it shares much of the same syntax and features while eliminating dangerous footguns and making it hard to write bad code.


## Getting Started

Check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/box/brainy/wiki/Getting-Started)
page on the wiki.


### Minimum Requirements

- PHP 7.3+
- `mbstring` PHP extension

The `mbstring` extension is required in order to properly support Unicode in templates and user-provided content. Brainy 3 cannot be run in a mode that does not handle Unicode properly.


## Contributing to Brainy

For information on how to set up a local dev environment and run the tests,

- Add proper PHPDoc annotations to all functions and methods.
- Refactoring:
  - Eliminate dead code
  - `@` error suppression
  - Increase code coverage
  - etc.
- Help identify and resolve potential security issues, or find ways to help developers avoid security issues.
